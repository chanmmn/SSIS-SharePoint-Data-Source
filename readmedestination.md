4. Replace the Input0_ProcessInputRow method with the following code. Of course, you need to change the siteUrl, password, and login name.

public override void Input0_ProcessInputRow(Input0Buffer Row)
{
	string siteUrl = "https://chanmm.sharepoint.com/DevSite/";
	 ClientContext clientContext = new ClientContext(siteUrl);
	 clientContext.Credentials = SingIn.Login();
	SP.List oList = clientContext.Web.Lists.GetByTitle("NewList");
	ListItemCreationInformation itemCreateInfo = new ListItemCreationInformation();
	ListItem oListItem = oList.AddItem(itemCreateInfo);
	oListItem["Title"] = Row.ProductName;
	 oListItem.Update();
	clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
}
